### My Process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

happy to get started with some javascript properties in the project, and i hope to be best at it. I was able to know more flexbox properties whereas some sematics on html also for example:

```html
<section>Some HTML code I'm proud of</section>
```
```javascript
 hamburger.addEventListener('click', () =>
 ```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```

### Continued development

i want to focus more on media query, css grid, positioning and css animations and the complex part(javascript), moreso get prepared for what coming next.
